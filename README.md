# Title: README Generator


![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)


## Description

This application will generate a README.md file based off the user input from the prompts in node js by running node index in the command line from the index.js file. I used Node JS and inquirer NPM package to make an interactive Command Line Interface (CLI). I faced the challenge of getting the prompts to display properly and not display when there was no user input and how to include them all.
